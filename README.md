# 2023-Phase-2

- Something about Phase 2 not just being about coding skills but also how they present themselves (both through their work and as themselves during presentations/interviews with Microsoft employees + employers)

We will be designing Phase 2 to utilise and be completed using just skills and technologies covered in Phase 1 modules. Anything additional outside of Phase 1 will not be required to complete Phase 2, unless stated otherwise (in which case, supplementary resources and help will be provided as part of Phase 2).
